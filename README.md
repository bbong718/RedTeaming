# Red Team Operations - MITRE ATT&CK Framework
## Preface 

Welcome to the Red Team Operations repository utilizing the MITRE ATT&CK framework. This README serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding the structure and organization of resources contained within this repository. Each section corresponds to a specific stage or tactic within the MITRE ATT&CK framework, designed for effective Red Teaming operations.

## Synopsis 

The MITRE ATT&CK framework is a globally recognized knowledge base that documents adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. This repository aligns with MITRE ATT&CK phases, providing structured directories where tools and scripts related to each tactic are stored. The goal is to facilitate organized Red Team operations by mapping activities to the established MITRE ATT&CK stages.

## Stages of MITRE ATT&CK

### 1. Reconnaissance/Preparation 
**Description:**  
The initial phase focuses on gathering intelligence about the target, crucial for planning effective attacks. This involves understanding the network architecture and identifying potential vulnerabilities.

**Techniques:**   
Network scanning to map out systems.  
Social engineering tactics to gather internal information.  

**Tools:**  
nmap for network discovery.  
theHarvester for email address harvesting.  
Directory: ./reconnaissance/  

### 2. Initial Access 
**Description:**  
The entry point into the target's environment, typically through exploiting vulnerabilities or social engineering.

**Techniques:**  
Phishing campaigns using crafted emails.  
Exploiting known vulnerabilities in remote services.  

**Tools:**
Phishing templates in ./initial_access/phishing/.  
Exploit scripts in ./initial_access/exploitation/.  
Directory: ./initial_access/  

### 3. Execution (Exploitation) 
**Description:**  
After gaining initial access, this stage focuses on executing malicious payloads to establish a foothold.

**Techniques:**  
Using exploit kits to leverage vulnerabilities.
Injecting malicious code into legitimate processes.

**Tools:**
Custom exploit scripts in ./execution/exploits/.  
Payload delivery mechanisms in ./execution/payloads/.  
Directory: ./execution/  

### 4. Persistence 
**Description:**  
Ensuring long-term access to the compromised environment, bypassing potential detection and logging out.

**Techniques:**  
Creating scheduled tasks for regular script execution.
Using legitimate administrative tools for persistence (e.g., ScheduledTasks).

**Tools:**  
Scripts for task scheduling in ./persistence/tasks/.  
Tools to maintain access via registry modifications in ./persistence/registry/.  
Directory: ./persistence/  

### 5. Privilege Escalation 
**Description:**  
Attempting to gain higher-level permissions within the targeted environment.

**Techniques:**  
Exploiting misconfigurations or known vulnerabilities.
Using credentials to access restricted areas.

**Tools:**  
Scripts for exploiting privilege escalation vulnerabilities in ./privilege_escalation/exploits/.  
Tools for password cracking and credential dumping in ./privilege_escalation/credentials/.  
Directory: ./privilege_escalation/  

### 6. Defense Evasion 
**Description:**  
Employing methods to avoid detection by security measures.

**Techniques:**  
Using encrypted communication channels.  
Obfuscating malicious code and processes.

**Tools:**  
Encrypting payloads using tools like bcrypt in ./defense_evasion/encryption.  
Process obfuscation techniques scripts in ./defense_evasion/obfuscation.  
Directory: ./defense_evasion/

### 7. Credential Access 
**Description:**  
Stealing credentials to gain broader access within the environment.

**Techniques:**
Using keyloggers or mimikatz for credential extraction.  
Exploiting weak authentication controls.  

**Tools:**  
Keylogging scripts in ./credential_access/keyloggers.  
Password dump tools in ./credential_access/dumpers.  
Directory: ./credential_access/  

### 8. Discovery 
**Description:**  
Understanding the environment to plan further attacks.

**Techniques:**  
Enumerating active users and system information.  
Mapping internal network structures.  

**Tools:**
Enumeration scripts in ./discovery/enumerate/.  
Network mapping tools like netview in ./discovery/map.  
Directory: ./discovery/  

### 9. Lateral Movement 
**Description:**  
Expanding access within the network to reach target assets.

**Techniques:**  
Using pass-the-hash attacks.  
Exploiting remote desktop protocols (RDP).  

**Tools:**  
PTH scripts in ./lateral_movement/pth.  
RDP exploitation tools in ./lateral_movement/exploitation.  
Directory: ./lateral_movement/

### 10. Collection 
**Description:**  
Gathering sensitive data or intellectual property.

**Techniques:**  
Searching for and exporting specific files.  
Extracting data from databases and other sources.  

**Tools:**  
File search utilities in ./collection/search.  
Database extraction scripts in ./collection/database.  
Directory: ./collection/

### 11. Exfiltration 
**Description:** 
Transferring collected information securely out of the network.

**Techniques:**  
Using secure protocols like HTTPS for data transfer.  
Encrypting exfiltrated data to avoid detection.  

**Tools:**  
Scripts for encrypted data transfer in ./exfiltration/transfer.  
Encryption tools for safeguarding data in ./exfiltration/encrypt.  
Directory: ./exfiltration/

### 12. Impact 
**Description:**  
Carrying out actions to disrupt operations, if part of the mission.

**Techniques:**  
Deleting critical files leading to downtime.  
Encrypting files and demanding ransom (in the case of ransomware attacks).  

**Tools:**  
File deletion scripts in ./impact/delete.  
Encryption mechanisms for ransomware in ./impact/encrypt.  
Directory: ./impact/
